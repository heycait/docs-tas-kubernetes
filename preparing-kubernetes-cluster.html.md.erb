This topic describes how to create and configure Kubernetes clusters to support 
Tanzu Application Service for Kubernetes.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Before creating or configuring Kubernetes clusters, 
ensure your environment and clusters support 
Tanzu Application Service for Kubernetes.  

Tanzu Application Service for Kubernetes 
supports Kubernetes clusters in the following environments:

* [VMware Enterprise PKS](#enterprise-pks)
* [VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid](#grid)

### <a id='enterprise-pks'></a> VMware Enterprise PKS

Ensure the following before creating or configuring Kubernetes clusters 
for Tanzu Application Service for Kubernetes:

* Your Enterprise PKS version is v1.6 or v1.7.
* Your Kubernetes clusters have been created with the following characteristics:  
    * The Kubernetes cluster has at least 5 worker nodes.
    * Each worker node has at least 2 CPU and 7.5&nbsp;GB of memory available for allocation.
    * The worker nodes in the Kubernetes clusters trust the container image registry that 
    Tanzu Application Service for Kubernetes uses to store buildpack-based app images. 
    If the registry has a certificate issued from a private certificate authority (CA), 
    this typically entails configuring the worker nodes in the Kubernetes cluster to trust 
    the certificate of that CA.

For information about creating a cluster with Enterprise PKS, 
see [Creating Clusters](https://docs.pivotal.io/pks/create-cluster.html) 
in the _VMware Enterprise PKS_ documentation.

After creating the cluster, 
run `pks get-credentials CLUSTER-NAME` to ensure that kubectl targets the cluster.

## <a id='grid'></a> VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid

Ensure the following before creating or configuring Kubernetes clusters 
for Tanzu Application Service for Kubernetes:

* Your Tanzu Kubernetes Grid environment:
    * Is Tanzu Kubernetes Grid version is 1.0 or later.  
    * Includes `metrics-server`. TKG does not bundle `metrics-server`, 
    which is required by Tanzu Application Service.
    To deploy `metrics-server`, run:

	    ```
	    $ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/download/v0.3.6/components.yaml
        ```
* Your Kubernetes clusters have been created with the following characteristics: 
    * The Kubernetes cluster has at least 5 worker nodes.
    * Each worker node has at least 2 CPU and 7.5&nbsp;GB of memory available for allocation.
    * The worker nodes in the Kubernetes clusters trust the container image registry that 
    Tanzu Application Service for Kubernetes uses to store buildpack-based app images. 
    If the registry has a certificate issued from a private certificate authority (CA), 
    this typically entails configuring the worker nodes in the Kubernetes cluster to trust 
    the certificate of that CA.

For information about setting up TKG, see [Installing Tanzu Kubernetes Grid]
(https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/1.0/vmware-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-10/GUID-install-tkg-index.html).  

After creating the cluster, run `tkg get credentials CLUSTER-NAME` to get the context name and `kubectl config use-context CONTEXT-NAME` to ensure that `kubectl` targets the cluster.

## <a id='configuring-vsphere-storage'></a> Configure Default Storage

Tanzu Application Service for Kubernetes requires each Kubernetes cluster 
provide persistent volumes for its internal PostgreSQL database and Minio blobstore.

To verify your Kubernetes cluster already has a default storage class installed:

1. Retrieve the list of StorageClass resources in the cluster:
  <pre><code>$ kubectl get storageclass</code></pre>
  For example:
  <pre><code>$ kubectl get storageclass
NAME             PROVISIONER                    AGE
thin (default)   kubernetes.io/vsphere-volume   34h
</code></pre>

1. If the list includes an entry for which `(default)` follows the storage class name, then the Kubernetes cluster has a default storage class installed already, and you are ready to provision volumes dynamically.

If the list does not include a default, you must install one before deploying Tanzu Application Service for Kubernetes.
See the [Configuring Default Storage](configuring-default-storage.html) topic for information about configuring the default storage class.

After you have completed the preparatory steps above, proceed to [configure Tanzu Application Service for Kubernetes](configuring-installation-values.html) for installation to the Kubernetes cluster.
