This topic describes the key components of the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) for Kubernetes tile.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

PAS for Kubernetes includes components that provide support for BOSH and PAS features as well as
other components that extend PAS functionality to the Kubernetes platform. To enable PAS features,
PAS for Kubernetes includes components from the Small Footprint PAS tile, such as the bits-service
and an internal Docker registry. The Eirini component enables PAS workloads to run on Kubernetes.

## <a id='small-footprint'></a> Small Footprint PAS Tile

The PAS for Kubernetes tile includes the system components and BOSH instance groups from the Small Footprint
PAS tile. The system components, including the bits-service and internal Docker registry, provide support for
apps that run on PAS.

For more information about the Small Footprint PAS tile, see the [Getting Started with Small Footprint
PAS](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/small-footprint.html) topic in the Pivotal Cloud Foundry documentation.

### <a id='bits-service'></a> Bits-Service

The PAS for Kubernetes tile deploys the bits-service to manage app and buildpack file assets on behalf of the
Cloud Controller. It supports Eirini by converting app droplets into Open Container Initiative (OCI) images.
Eirini then refers to the OCI images when it runs those apps on the Kubernetes cluster.

For more information about the bits-service, see the [bits-service repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bits-service) on GitHub.

### <a id='docker-registry'></a> Internal Docker Registry

The PAS for Kubernetes tile deploys an internal Docker registry to host the container images for the Loggregator
components that run on the Kubernetes worker nodes.

For more information about Loggregator in PAS for Kubernetes, see [How App Logging Works](how-app-logging-works.html).

## <a id='eirini'></a> Eirini

The Eirini component enables app workloads to run on Kubernetes by translating the app from its representation in
Cloud Controller into a StatefulSet resource in Kubernetes. Eirini works with Cloud Controller to monitor and compare
the sets of started apps to the StatefulSet resources. If Eirini detects a difference between a set of started apps and
its corresponding StatefulSet, Eirini updates the StatefulSet to match the set of started apps.

Eirini also registers HTTP routes for app instances with active routes and relays container metrics from
Kubernetes into the Loggregator system.

For more information about Eirini, see the [Eirini Project](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/project-eirini/).
