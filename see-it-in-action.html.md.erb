## <a id='verify'></a> Verify the Installation

If you want to verify that the installation succeeded, do the following:

1. To see that PAS is running workloads on Kubernetes, push an app to your PAS environment by running `cf push APP_NAME`.

1. Observe a pod being created for your app by running the following command:

  ```
kubectl get pods -n pas-workloads
  ```
