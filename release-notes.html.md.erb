### <a id='features-0-3-0'></a> Features

New features and changes in this release:

- Platform operators can copy system-component images into another registry and deploy TAS for Kubernetes to use those relocated images.
- Platform operators can configure their own certificates on the TAS for Kubernetes ingress gateway for TLS termination.
- TAS for Kubernetes incorporates [Paketo cloud-native buildpacks](https://paketo.io/) for Java, NodeJS, Go, .NET Core, PHP, HTTPD, and nginx.
- Istio sidecar proxies prevent all communication between apps on the Kubernetes Pod network.
<%#
- Bump Istio to version `1.4.5`
- Bump kpack to version `0.0.9`
#%>

### <a id='known-issues-0-3-0'></a> Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

- Retrieving app and buildpack-staging logs with `cf logs` requires cf CLI v6.50.0 or later.
- App instance logs also include unfiltered logs from the Istio sidecar proxy process and can be noisy as a result.
- The `cf buildpacks` command shows an empty list of buildpacks.
- Does not support cf CLI `buildpack-administration` commands.
- App developers cannot select a buildpack for their buildpack-based apps.
- The TAS for Kubernetes ingress gateway service may interfere with traffic for other Kubernetes Services in the cluster.
- TAS for Kubernetes cannot use the AWS Elastic Container Registry as its app image registry.
- Does not support upgrading an existing TAS for Kubernetes installation to a new version.
- Does not support re-deploying TAS for Kubernetes with different credentials.


## <a id='0-2-0'></a> v0.2.0

**Release Date: May 29, 2020**

### <a id='features-0-2-0'></a> Features

New features and changes in this release:

- The `cf app` command now displays CPU and memory usage metrics for app instances.
- Component metrics for Cloud Controller are now available for Prometheus to scrape via conventional `prometheus.io` annotations.
- Load-balancer options are now configured via the `enable_load_balancer` template parameter instead of via moving template overlay files.
- Ingress routing without a Kubernetes-provisioned load balancer no longer creates the `istio-ingressgateway` Kubernetes service.


### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fixes:

- Apps can now receive ingress traffic through both HTTP and HTTPS.
- Buildpack-staging logs are now streamed during `cf push`.
- Running `cf restage` now restages the app successfully.
- Running buildpack-based apps no longer requires the `diego_docker` feature flag to be set.
