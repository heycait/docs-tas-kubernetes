This topic discusses how to uninstall Tanzu Application Service for Kubernetes.

## <a id='uninstalling-k8s'></a> Uninstalling Kubernetes Resources

To uninstall the Tanzu Application Service for Kubernetes resources installed to the Kubernetes cluster, run:

```
$ kapp delete -a cf
```

This deletion command also deletes the pods and other resources that correspond to running application instances and buildpack builds.


## <a id='removing-app-images'></a> Removing App Images

Uninstalling the Tanzu Application Service for Kubernetes resources from the Kubernetes cluster does not delete any app images pushed to the app-image registry. To delete them, delete the repositories that Tanzu Application Service for Kubernetes has created in the registry.
