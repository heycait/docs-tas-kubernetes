<%= partial 'pre_alpha_warning' %>

PAS for Kubernetes aims to bring the development experience of PAS on top of the Kubernetes container orchestrator. As of this first alpha release, PAS for Kubernetes is packaged as an Ops Manager tile, deployable with BOSH, and depends on PKS, vSphere, and NSX-T.

This first release is based of the Small Footprint PAS tile. As a proof-of-concept, it supports the most important features of PAS, such as `cf push` for many buildpack-based apps, while running the PAS app instances on Kubernetes. Support for complicated app configurations and advanced developer workflows will improve in later releases.
