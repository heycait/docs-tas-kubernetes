This topic describes how to prepare to install Pivotal Application Service (PAS) for Kubernetes.

To prepare for installation, you must meet the prerequisites and configure the BOSH Director security settings.

## <a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

To install and use PAS for Kubernetes, you need the following:

- Ops Manager deployed.

- Enterprise Pivotal Container Service (PKS) v1.5 or later installed.

- The `pks` CLI installed on your local machine. For more information, see [Installing the PKS CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/runtimes/pks/installing-pks-cli.html).

- The Kubernetes CLI, `kubectl`, installed on your local machine. For more information, see [Install and Set Up kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) in the Kubernetes documentation.

- An OCI registry. We would suggest using [VMWare Harbor Registry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/harbor-container-registry/).
