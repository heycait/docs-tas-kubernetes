Pivotal Application Service (PAS) for Kubernetes combines the development experience of PAS and the Kubernetes container orchestrator. PAS for Kubernetes is packaged as an Ops Manager tile, is deployable with BOSH, and has dependencies on PKS, vSphere, and NSX-T.

PAS for Kubernetes includes the most important features of PAS, such as `cf push` for many buildpack-based apps, while running PAS app instances on Kubernetes.
